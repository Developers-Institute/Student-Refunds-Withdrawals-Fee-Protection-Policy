      <td>
        <p>Changes in the policy will be made to ensure a compliant student fee protection structure and procedures are in place at all times.

    </td>

       <tr>
    <td valign="top"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>
      <td>
        <p><strong>Course Closure Event</strong> -  In the event that NZQA decides that Developers Institute is no longer delivering or capable of delivering the course for which students are enrolled. Should Developers Institute's refund policies fail, then the student fee protection mechanism(s) will be triggered. This includes students who have enrolled and paid but have not yet started the course.</p>
          <p><strong>Enrolment Cancellation</strong> -  An enrolment cancellation is the withdrawal of a student from a programme or course(s) without academic penalty. An enrolment cancellation may be initiated by Developers Institute or by the student concerned.</p>
          <p>An enrolment cancellation is a form of withdrawal, as defined by the Tertiary Education Commission Rules. The student enrolment will not be reported in the Single Data Return (SDR).</p>
          <p><strong>The Last Withdrawal Date</strong> - occurs when 60% of the course is completed. If
a student withdraws from a programme or course(s) before this date their
Academic Record will show “Withdrawn” for the course(s).</p>
          <p><strong>Non-Starter</strong> - A student who does not attend or engage in learning within the first 15 working days (three weeks) of a course or programme. For courses/programmes longer than 8 weeks but shorter than 12 weeks this time period is 10 working days (two weeks).</p>
        <p><strong>Single Data Return (SDR)</strong> - Provides the base data for compilation and analysis of tertiary education statistics on Student enrolments; enrolments and withdrawals for funding purposes; qualification and course completions, progressions, and retentions. This information is used for reporting and monitoring purposes, such as monitoring enrolments against an Investment Plan, or tracking completions and attrition for qualifications at specific Tertiary Education Organisations (TEOs).</p>
        <p><strong>Student Fees</strong> - The total tuition course costs and other financial commitments directly associated with the course for which the student has enrolled, and which are payable by the student, together with any other commitments that are required to be paid by the student to Developers Institute.</p>
        <p><strong>Refunds</strong> - Paid fees that become refundable to students in compliance with this policy.  Any refund of fees made under the requirements of this policy shall be paid wherever possible, to the person or organisation that made the original payment, or otherwise directly to the student, or to an alternative provider as directed by the student, or to the Ministry of Social Development in the case of student loans.</p>
        <p><strong>Transfer</strong> - The process for a student studying the same programme but moving to a different course or course occurrence, for example a different semester delivery of the same course. A transfer is allowed within the first 15 working days (three weeks) of enrolment on a course or programme. For courses/programmes between 8 - 11 weeks this time period is 10 working days (two weeks). If a student changes their programme of study, this is treated as an Enrolment Cancellation and a separate enrolment for the new programme of study is required.</p>
        <p><strong>Verification of Study (VOS)</strong> - Is a process that provides StudyLink with the necessary information from education providers to enable and assess a student's entitlement for Student Allowances and/or Student Loans.</p>
        <p><strong>Withdrawal</strong> - A withdrawal is the formal removal of a student’s enrolment from a programme or course(s) after the last cancellation date and before the last withdrawal date. The student enrolment will be reported in the Single Data Return (SDR) and their Academic Record will show “Withdrawn” for the course(s).</p>
          <p><strong>Withdrawing Student Survey</strong> - For students who cancel their enrolment or withdraw before completing their course(s) or programme of study. Where possible this should be completed during a learning conversation with the student’s tutor, the Programme Coordinator or Wellbeing Manager. The survey is part of the Cancellation/Withdrawal Form.</p>
