        <p><strong>“Closure event” means the following:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>(a) a provider is no longer delivering or capable of delivering in which students are enrolled;</li>
        <li>(b) a provider is closed following regulatory action by NZQA;</li>
        <li>(c) a provider becomes insolvent;</li>
        <li>(d) a provider ceases to operate or loses its body corporate status;</li>
        <li>(e) New Zealand Qualifications Authority cancels the provider’s accreditation, approval or registration under the Education and Training Act 2020.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the event that NZQA decides that Developers Institute is no longer delivering or capable of delivering the course for which students are enrolled. Should Developers Institute's refund policies fail, then the student fee protection mechanism(s) will be triggered. This includes students who have enrolled and paid but have not yet started the course.</p>
          <p><strong>Enrolment Cancellation</strong> -  An enrolment cancellation is the withdrawal of a student from a programme or course(s) without academic penalty. An enrolment cancellation may be initiated by Developers Institute or by the student concerned.</p>
          <p>An enrolment cancellation is a form of withdrawal, as defined by the Tertiary Education Commission Rules. The student enrolment will not be reported in the Single Data Return (SDR).</p>
          <p><strong>Last Withdrawal Date</strong> - occurs when up to 60% of the course is completed. If a student withdraws from a programme or course(s) before this date their Academic Record will show “Withdrawn” for the course(s).</p>
          <p><strong>Non-Starter</strong> - A student who does not attend or engage in learning within the first 10 working days (two weeks) of a course or programme. For courses/programmes longer than 8 weeks but shorter than 12 weeks this time period is 8 days.</p>
        <p><strong>Single Data Return (SDR)</strong> - Provides the base data for compilation and analysis of tertiary education statistics on Student enrolments; enrolments and withdrawals for funding purposes; qualification and course completions, progressions, and retentions. This information is used for reporting and monitoring purposes, such as monitoring enrolments against an Investment Plan, or tracking completions and attrition for qualifications at specific Tertiary Education Organisations (TEOs).</p>
        <p><strong>Student Fees</strong> - The total tuition course costs, student services fee, compulsory course costs and other financial commitments directly associated with the course for which the student has enrolled, and which are payable by the student, together with any other commitments that are required to be paid by the student to Developers Institute.</p>
        <p><strong>Refunds</strong> - Paid fees that become refundable to students in compliance with this policy. Any refund of fees made under the requirements of this policy shall be paid wherever possible, to the person or organisation that made the original payment, or otherwise directly to the student, or to an alternative provider as directed by the student, or to the Ministry of Social Development in the case of student loans.</p>
        <p><strong>Refund Period</strong> - The refund period refers to any point in time prior to the start of a programme or when the student’s fees are paid to the Public Trust account and ends on or before 5pm of the eighth day after the start of a programme.</p>
        <p><strong>Transfer</strong> - The process for a student studying the same programme but moving to a different course or course occurrence, for example a different semester delivery of the same course. A transfer is allowed within the first 15 working days (three weeks) of enrolment on a course or programme. For courses/programmes between 8 - 11 weeks this time period is 8 days. If a student changes their programme of study, this is treated as an Enrolment Cancellation and a separate enrolment for the new programme of study is required..</p>
        <p><strong>Verification of Study (VOS)</strong> - Is a process that provides StudyLink with the necessary information from education providers to enable and assess a student's entitlement for Student Allowances and/or Student Loans.</p>
        <p><strong>Withdrawal</strong> - A withdrawal is the formal removal of a student’s enrolment from a programme or course(s) after the last cancellation date and before the last withdrawal date. The student enrolment will be reported in the Single Data Return (SDR) and their Academic Record will show “Withdrawn” for the course(s).</p>
          <p><strong>Withdrawing Student Survey</strong> - For students who cancel their enrolment or withdraw before completing their course(s) or programme of study. Where possible this should be completed during a learning conversation with the student’s tutor, the Programme Coordinator or Wellbeing Manager. The survey is part of the Cancellation/Withdrawal Form.</p>

        <li>4.1 A student is liable for the payment of all fees (or having confirmed their eligibility for the Ministry of Social Development or Tertiary Education Commission to pay fees on their behalf) when they accept an Offer of Study or are approved for any change of programme or course enrolled. </li>
         <li>4.2 Students who do not attend a course or programme which they have formally accepted an Offer of Place, will be liable for payment of the fees unless they have withdrawn from the programme during the refund period.</li>
         <li>4.3 Payment of all fees shall be made by the payment due date shown on the Fees Invoice sent to students. This includes arrangements for payment by a student loan through the Ministry of Social Development before payment is due. Self-funded learners shall make fee payments directly to their Public Trust student account indicated by Developers Institute.</li>
         <li>4.4 A late payment penalty of $100 will apply where fees are not paid by the due date.</li>

         </li>
         <li>4.6 Developers Institute reserves the right to place debts with its appointed debt recovery agency for collection from the student and/or recover any debt through legal proceedings. Developers Institute also reserves the right to recover any additional costs in relation to this debt collection from the student, including an application to seek damages in the Courts of New Zealand.</li>
         <li>4.7 When a course or programme is cancelled by Developers Institute after paid enrolments have been received, students shall be entitled to an automatic refund of all fees, course costs and health levies, without incurring an administration fee.</li>
         <li>4.8 When a closure event occurs, students may be taught out until the course or programme is finished as directed by the NZQA; or offered re-enrolment in a suitable course, if available, to complete the qualification as directed by NZQA; or entitled partial refund of their fees determined by the Public Trust.</li>
         <li>4.9 Students can withdraw from their course or programme at any time, provided that they have not completed more than 60% of their course or programme. Only withdrawals made during the refund period are entitled to receive a refund.</li>
         <li>4.10 Developers Institute will refund an amount equal to the sum of the amount paid, subject to any administrative charges for withdrawals made during the refund period. Developers Institute may charge an administrative fee of $500 or 10% of the amount of total fees paid, whichever is lesser.</li>

         <p>In the following situations, a Student must be treated as an enrolment cancellation, from a programme in which the student was enrolled with Developers Institute:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>(a) where the Student fails to attend or participate in the programme in the first 2 weeks from the commencement of the programme; or</li>
             <li>(b) where the Student attends or participates in the programme during the Refund Period, but stops attending or participating in the programme before the end of the Refund Period.</li>
           </ul>
           <br>
           <p>Rule 4.12(b) does not apply where the Student attends or participates in that programme after the end of the Refund Period.</p>
           <br>
           <li>
             4.13 Refunds of fee payments derived from the Student Loan scheme will be credited to StudyLink. Where fee payment has been derived only in part from the Student Loan scheme, refunds will be credited back to StudyLink to the value of the Student Loan payment and any balance then be refunded to the student.</li>
         <li>4.14 Refunds of fee payments from self-funded students will be administered by the Public Trust and credited to their nominated bank account.</li>
         <li>4.15 Refunds may be withheld from students who have outstanding debt to Developers Institute and shall only be made in the amount of any such reduction of debt.</li>
         <li>4.16 Students on temporary visas in New Zealand must ensure that their visa conditions allow them to study in New Zealand, prior to the start of their programme. If a student’s application for a student visa is refused prior to the start of their study, their enrolment will be cancelled and they will be provided with a full refund. If a student has started study but has not maintained a valid visa, they will have their enrolment cancelled and may be entitled to a pro-rata refund, on a case-by-case basis.</li>
         <li>4.17 Transfer from one course or programme to another programme within Developers Institute can be carried out provided that there are no negative financial consequences for Developers Institute, and notification of the written request to transfer is received within the first three weeks of the programme start date. Where there are financial consequences, the transfer is to be treated as a course or programme withdrawal and a new study application is to be made.</li>
         <li>4.18 All refunds shall comply with the Student Refunds, Withdrawals and Fee Protection Policy unless exceptional circumstances have been approved by the Chief Executive.</li>
